Next I want to see a rules list from him on work life balance
 In his case, his work is his life, but does he expect the same from his entire team? If someone has children and wants to dedicate time to them, are they punished in his eyes since they may leave by 6pm most days?

  Better advice would be to invite everyone who needs to be at the meeting and no one else
Don't use acronyms? So when we talk about HTML we need to say hypertext markup language every time? Or cascading style sheets instead of CSS? Or PHP instead of PHP?Edit: I guess I needed to put /s

 If you want to start a business that involves software, know enough about software to know a little bit about what's hard to do and what's not, basic knowledge so you can communicate your ideas, and for goodness sake please have a business plan where you can explain how you plan to market and sell this product after launch
 Market research on whether anybody actually wants it would be nice too
 Entrepreneurs need to understand how to communicate well technically, but I suggest pseudocode
 A remedial junior level programmer that will buy into every lame excuse is not what the project needs at its head
 Whatever an entrepreneur needs the goal is to push what is feasible up to the level the market demands for viability
 That's why nobody wants that known before launch
 I understand the "I'll pay you in equity" line is mostly garbage, so I just want to pay someone, how do I not get fleeced?I've have like twenty documents and mockups and a friend already made a shitty version of the app, I just need someone to make it
I think there are always levels of grey here that people need to remember, but other than that
 I just want to add that those rules apply to STRANGERS AS WELL AS FRIENDS
 Validating if people need or want your service or product AND are willing to pay for it in some fashion is really important and overlooked all the time
  If you want to do something with yours, put in the effort to become technically savvy enough to generate more than just an idea if you are serious about starting a tech companyHere's what I don't like

To be successful, a startup needs a good idea (great is even better), a great team and enough cash to keep them engaged, good timing, and a fair bit of luck
  If you really have the skills but not an idea, AND you want to do your own thing, the time it takes to listen might be the best you ever spent
WTF do I need you for?
 What languages or coding skills are most useful? What should I start with? I have a business knowledge and want to be able to talk to the developers about it and understand the limitations of the code
Honesty upfront: i know negative knowledge about tech(read :i know so little about comp sci that i dont even know the right questions to know the right answers leading to the billionare solutions)However i do know two things 1)20 years from now will give time for the potential new millionare and billionares of the western world due to the increases in tech and healthcare And 2) i have a small clue " what" those tech companies would need to be My question: is a degree in compsci and a mba enough? What kind of development need  be learned to know that you know enough about those questions to get to those awesome new solutions? Other question :With enough time i can save for thos potential pie in the sky startup 
Having a good idea is easy, being a man with a good will, and with the thought I can do this is a bit difficult, we need to know that everything depends on how much we want or do not want to think that our  idea will be implemented!!
Idea & Team - "Idea" vs "Expert in the needs of users"  Is it a good idea?  - I would agree with Paul Graham, what you need is to understand   the needs of your users
 If you can show you understand why    people need the product today, then you have a good idea
 You need a good team, people  who respect each other

 There are so many startups who need a seasoned CTO but can’t afford one full time, and I get paid a lot more now to work less and not be owned by anyone

 You need any two of idea, technical skills, and money

Great PostI'm not sure if they need to code or not
 Does the developer need to know  the basics of sales and marketing?As for worth, investors do know thier worth, they measure it in dollars
 I have the marketing and written campaign together, all i need is a team honestly 
 I know i will get backlash, but i also know there are money hungry adepts out here like me that just need a good shot and good plan to execute, if you doubt in what i am saying then please dont comment only comment if you're interested in the app and idea!

 I immediately understand why I want to use the platform

 As you mentioned motivation is a biggie, consultants might not be super passionate about your product but they want next week's paycheck, additionally they have experience on dozens of projects
 Sure, losing one of them would be a huge loss to the bottom line, but if you change your service to meet their needs, you might end up hurting your ability to service clients in the future
We need more story like this
 As for my believe, I'd always say do it all by ypurself especially production, dont hire, but you made me realiaze and rethink more of how impirtant you need someone that is free from technical thinking process (from day-to-day work) for bigger view of business

 I want to ask you to share this your story with our Facebook support group, Startups Global! Thank you! 
 A lot of work needs to be put in, I'm not disputing that
We are not currently accepting funding, however it's nice to know that it's available if we need it
  I also think that telling everyone we do not want money is turning out to be the best way to build up buzz, which is something we did not anticipate
> raising money is not the solution to growthUnless of course you actually need money to help develop a product
TL;DR: tell investors what they want to hear and ask for the opposite of what you want
What if you need money to continue developing your product? Why is it bad to say money is going towards developing a product that is more valuable to users and features that will encourage growth? 
 Why do startups need investors? If I make solid money at my day job and develop some software and a product on the side, all I really need money for is the purchase order for what I need to buy in materials before I sell something
 If you NEED money and truly seek advice and want to find out how to get there yourself then the money will eventually come because your intentions are pure 
 I work on it part time though I do have an employee that chips away at it as well as other contracts I get from side clients who want a website built here and there

 Company is still alive you just no longer wanted to be a part of it
So you lived for 9 years on $100k, building what you wanted to build? Doesn't seem like suicide to me
You don't need to meditate every day, but do try to do it at least twice a week
com and sell the domain for 5 - 10k and disclose that there is a $60m company that wants this domain
 (But you might want to actually consult your own lawyer to be safe
Big companies want to scare you to prevent paying a fair amount
 For example write a fancy email saying that 7K was your initial offer but now you have developed brand more and that you now want 10K for the domain
 There are a few things that can make it clearer to you what your options are:  Was the trademark issued before you registered the domain?  Did you register a trademark for your company name?  Do you have the money $750 to $5k to fight an ICANN dispute if they filed one?  Sounds to me like they want to just buy it from you
Ask for 10K - they obviously want it - trademarks only apply to direct competitors
You already have some great legal advice in this thread, but want to add my points as we are in a similar situation, except that we are on the other side
 Give these arguments, via emails if you are not confident via phone (don't use the phones, where they can say whatever they want, whatever threat without any traces)
 But if someone wanted to trademark it (or with combination) for fireworks company it would be fine
If you want to hold onto the domain, do so, but realize they may sue in which case you'll need to lawyer up
 What you really need is good legal advice and possibly representation
 You need an attorney that knows this area inside and out
  They obv want it
 Looks like they want to negotiate you a little lower
 B) This is my domain, I like it and I want to use it for real/legal project
I think you have all the leverage you need
jpThey have so many choices, why the fuck do they want the 
 If you choose to do this, be prepared to have a lawyer on retainer to kick to in case they want to take it to court
 Fold like a wet blanket and give them whatever they want for whatever they want and eat the cost of rebranding and the new domain name
 Only do this if you don't want to worry about them ever again
 Work with them to get what you both want, and they might go away if it's too much work, or too much of a hassle
 From another webapp founder, do you feel the need to provide a native app in the near future?  Would love to know the name of your product so I can follow along!
 You need to always look out for your best interest both proactively and aggressively
 The other person might not want to initial your changes (which reveals their selfishness), but at least you are not committing to something unfair
Thanks for the comments all, couple things I wanted to make clear:1) The reason I got so fired up yesterday was that I found out WellRespectedShop is ripping off my product and not an hour later got an email from MouthOnFace guy saying he wasn't going to pay anything (he's been accruing interest on an invoice he agreed to - in writing - for a year now)
This should go without saying, but most people often ignore it b/c they're penny wise, pound foolish - always get a lawyer to review everything you sign and to draft everything you want into a document
  I want to smash my computer everyday, but then again, great achievements require great sacrifice right?
Ultimately if you want your product out there any time soon and you aren't a developer by trade you're going to need to hire someone who is
 Marketing is hard if you want to earn money
 You don't need to learn how to code, you need to learn the fundamentals of how something is built with code
 You don't need to learn it enough to write but enough to understand how something is built
 I can easily find good coders for what I need - and hire them only when it's the right time to do so
so i can't code and have an idea that needs some coding to make work
How do i go about working out what i need to learn to execute my idea?
I've never once met a founder who thinks he needs to learn accounting because his startup needs some bookkeeping work done
 These are all crucial things that you need to know and have a strong comp sci background so you can even come up with a detailed and accurate specification for your project, long before the coding starts
 Coding is just one of a dozen different skills you need to launch and run a tech startup
no you need to hire someone that can code
Especially if you want to do a tech startup, I **highly** recommend you learn to code
Op, I really needed this post
How much time would I need to -actually- "code"? 
 We work in atoms and watch others like us light their limited capital dollars on fire because they need "professional 3D mockups" of their mvp which ends up not even working
 I have a web-app I want to build similar to Duolingo
If you want beginner-friendly, just use JS
I didn't want to spew bullshit
And so it goes, it's not like it matters while the money is easy and a few people are throwing away a few of their best years working insane hours to catch up with the lingo? Nobody talks about burnout, nobody wants that negative attitude
 If you want a job that makes sense or is sane, don’t work for a VC or startup
  Haven't had experience with a lot of the "startup" 401k companies, as in they only offer etfs which can be fine for some people but frustrate those who want certain investment options
 People rant Vanguard Vanguard Vanguard, but they really don't give a shit about the administration, they just want their investments
 Banks and insurance providers are normally terrible for 401ks, just not their business model and they only want to pump money out of them or keep you at their company for everything
 Really what you want to make sure is payroll syncing goes easily for you and employees can set their contributions easily

 Remember a friend is worth way more than a website, in my book anyway, so you might just need to cut your loses and don't get too worked up over it
 Considering you're posting this on a monday; his "ghosting" you might just mean he wants to not work this weekend - as a contractor; he has no obligation of which hours to work for you - and unless your scope included a due date for change requests, no due date
If it's so simple, why do you need to outsource it? You are casually demeaning his work and whoever you hire's work without the ability to do it on your own
How much rework did you cover, are you sure you don't need to send him the rest of his pay? When he asked for half of his pay, are you sure he wasn't suggesting he didn't have the time to rework it (and couldn't work with your requirements) and was giving you a discount because he knew you weren't happy and wanted to salvage the friendship?
Hey, in an effort to help each other grow and get you to the next level, I wanted to chime in
##Extreme ownershipProblems on his side have been outlined a bazillion times everywhere, but a quick search will turn them up: not responding, changes take some time, slow back and forth, whatever you want to call it
 If you truly showed him a simple five-page design then there shouldn't need rounds (!) of changes
 Low and behold, one and a half months later, and the website has massive design issues, and isn't done**_ – this one doesn't need much explanation
 If it's gone this long, there are very obviously issues on both sides in terms of communication (you communicating your project needs, and him communicating on the delivery)1
 Do either of Wed or Thurs mornings work for you?"_From there, write out point form notes (to yourself) on what you want to discuss, and come up with a complete list of what's been asked so far
 Get rid of things that _seem_ needed and focus hard on the ones that are worth it
 Tell him you want to make it easy for him (because you do, right?) and want to understand what's going on on his end in case there's an easy fix
 you'll need to walk away with whatever you have at this point and take him out for a nice dinner & drinks (he's upset, too, remember so he's feeling underpaid)
 Otherwise, on a 5-page site, you're most likely going to want to get a bare bones delivery that works, and pay the final amount
You don't want to get into a _"You did this
 Any of that might be acceptable from a friendship perspective, but at this point you need to treat him like a respected developer and he needs to treat you like a respected client
 Who knows?! At this point you just need to communicate and put your cards on the table
 There's no way you need to hang up the phone without re-assessing everything and committing to making a friend happy given a crappy situation
  My friend works his butt off and is good at airsoft tech which we need to be successful
 What you don't want to do is have him find out you went to someone else and they had it done in a week
Did you already have designs that he just needed to implement? 
Hired a friend to create a shopify store for me w/ an advertising backend (he wants to get into advertising)Similar situation, at one point ghosted me for 2 weeks
 If you are interested in maintaining the relationship, just let him know that it's a business decision you need to make
 There will probably be some fallout that occurs but you need to be very matter-of-fact and professional and just treat it as a normal business move (because it is) and nothing more
 Now, it might get a little complicated if you want to get the money back
  I worked with these people for some 3 years, they needed some money, I stepped up to help, got burned
 You can say that you want to try to get it set up locally yourself
 Presumably, you will want additional work done later on this site even after it is launched so you will probably need to find someone else in the future anyway
 I have run a business in the past and exited but I needed a co-founder this time to pursue funding and I sorta leveraged the only guy I knew who could code and honestly trust
 I think the business is awesome and viable but I need a team and money
 It is a weird situation because I don't want him thinking I don't trust or respect him but I don't want him taking a co-founder role if he isn't that invested and he quite frankly is not that good at software dev, despite what his resume may suggest
 While I don't disagree that something isn't quite right, I want to suggest improving the communications on your end from a professional viewpoint
 Try something along the lines of, "Hey n0tspencer, I just wanted to touch base with you on the current status of the project
Do you have a contract in place? How much was paid up front and how much will be paid after completion?You need to be firm with him and address the issues
 Sure, if somebody gives me a design I can implement it, but I need more direction and somebody to point out to me where my implementation differs from the design
  Regardless, unless you can foot the bill for a FTE or are experienced enough to document what needs to be completed to support contract work, you are bound to be disappointed time and time again
 Assuming you've seen him develop similar websites in the past that work well, so possibly not skill? If just time, he needs to correctly communicate hours spent versus remaining and just explain why delayed
I own a web // software developer company, if you need a hand feel free to shoot me a PM
Did this really surprise you? If yes, you could benefit of more critical thinking, if no, maybe you need to be less kind when making business decisions
 He wanted me to build his namesake car, the "Barrister"
 These teams often need that super-charismatic, soft-skill, half mad-man guy to pull his part of the impossible enigma load that is a startup
 But as soon as you have to move somewhere in unchartered territory, the best detail workers will need guidance and leadership to make an enterprise worthwhile
 But financials need actual numbers - not just fairy tale dreams
Worse was he really wanted to be a non-profit, but was too lazy to do the paperwork and bookkeeping that comes with being a non-profit
 Saying there’s no place would be like saying there’s no need for a head coach on a football team just because they aren’t touching the ball
 The team needs to be on the same page and agree on the roles and value of those roles
Too often, people want to be in a start up or entrepreneurs and sit back as “CEO” because frankly, they’re lazy
 They want to reap the benefits but not work hard
 Or worse, they want to work “smart instead of hard
I totally agree that having skills and actually shipping something thats actually helping you to push the needle is crucial
 Everything is Sales Person: You need these guys, all they do is print money because all they see are opportunities to print money
 Basically a solid job class all around, you definitely want at least one of these guys, even if they're lower rank
 I'm great at figuring out how to solve problems and what steps we need to take, what resources we need, etc, in a creative way
 They said we needed to be more like Glowforge
 He told me I needed some millenials to really make progress- that I was probably too old to really be able to move fast enough to reach the market
 A pain that needs a solution
 They put all this work into it and so they will stop at nothing to get people to pay for it, even if they don’t want it
 It’s a bit nerve racking as I plan to launch my own company in the next few months which will need serious funding but doesn’t fit the “same idea different industry” that seems to be getting all the funding
   However, to your point, this ecosystem does have stink-bombs and Theranos isn't an anomaly, so if we are discussing those only, then yes, they are a waste of time and money, but the vast majority of companies can be seen as pitches, with good VC's only needing to bat 
What do you mean by validation? Is it that people want a thing? Valid when free =/= valid when paid
 That people have a need that they will pay to have addressed
Also, you don't need revenue to make money as an investor, but you need to know your exit strategy will be dependent on a strategic buyer acquiring company for another reason
A startup isn't just any new business that merely needs to understand the revenue model to survive
Even on a "build it an they will come" project, we need to be validating that we can get the number of eyeballs we think we can, and that the buyer (usually advertisers) are actually willing to pay for the eyeballs that we could send their way
 As for the last spot you want a heavy hitter in the sales/management department
 Ask each company who wants your project if they'd like to invest in your idea
 Just be happy you figured out something cool and people want it
 If you don't want to do that you should partner with someone with enough coding skills and drive to help you build it
 This is extremely difficult as this kind of person also wants money not promises—they get pitched all the time with people hyping their ideas
 You need to better understand the strengths and weaknesses in your idea and yourself so that when you do reach out to other people, you know what you need from them
 If they are interested, they need to put a deposit down of X
** They want to have business with you? Make it official
First of all - don't panic and build what you want
Welcome to the world of computer vision, where you need to find problems that are worth solving, scalable and feasible
> Now I'm nowhere close to an MVP but already have 3 big potential customers that want to speakI hate to be negative, because I want to encourage you and tell you that you are on the right path (you are)
 But 3 big customers wanting to speak with you is not traction and not even close
 I have had businesses with 50-80 big customers wanting to speak and it didn't lead to meaningful traction
 Remember the social media facebook? Zuckerberg was the best coder and all he needed was an idea which he stole from the twins
 For starters, in order to give you an honest assessment of should you leave school and focus on your start up you'd need to provide:1
 Before you reach the point where you can onboard customer 1 you need to have your business properly set up for your location (ex: in the US you may form an LLC)
You don't need to take investor money if you don't want to
 Avoid them if you want to stay in control of your business"
 But if you say that the contract is worth $10M, the profit will be $4M, and you only need $2
 Most likely you would need to do a party round with a group of ~5 or so angels, and you should focus on those in manufacturing and specifically in your field
 Late edit: I want to share some of the VC mindset and why I don't think that's a likely option for you
 I'd look at your company and say "a $10M contract is impressive, and if the tech is scalable I'd definitely want in"
How definite is the contract? Also, just to clarify, is the contract $10 million in product, revenue, or expected profit? I only ask because if you basically have 10 million guaranteed on the line and all you need is capital to connect it up, then maybe a business loan is the quickest? Just food for thought
 The question is, do you really need outside capital to make this work? Selling equity is always more expensive than getting cash
If you only need 25% of your contract to facilitate manufacturing, I would propose renegotiating a deal with your client and asking for 25% upfront to cover manufacturing
 Deliver for your client and the necessary people will want to come in to your project by themselves
 PM me if you need more
 From your other comments, you have:* $1 million pre-payment* $9 million after that (assuming on delivery of inventory)You need an additional $2
 First, you need a plan to be able to ramp up in your time frame
 Reach out to your suppliers and make sure the things you need to buy are available (or will be) in time
) In parallel, you need to be looking for financing that can close fast so you can execute towards you plan
 Remember those quotes you got in step 1? This is where you can tally them all up and meeting with commercial lenders to show them you need this amount of money by this time
 Since you've prioritized your plan, you have the most urgent things you need
 You have a plan for when you need things and where they'll go, and who will handle them
You need to do an angel investor round and I would have the angel/mentor with gravitas help you connect with a mezz lender simultaneously
 I think everyone is going to be cautious about how you got a big contract and it needs to be a take-or-pay contract
 You need to demonstrate how you can perform profitably
You need to be doing this today as your timeframe is aggressive to say the least
 It sounds like you want an investor/advisor
 Many of them will want to give you horrible terms
 This structure solves the need for quick funding, but valuation would still be an issue
Great news! You can look into a line of credit from investors \(you were saying you wanted the guidance as well rather than just a bank\)
 So let's say you need 5 mill up front, they'll loan it and use the PO as collateral
 The scope as an individual to land a $10M contract needs to BE extremely extremely precise
On financing, your best bet (which I'm sure you don't want to hear) is to go back to your customer and ask them to write you a bigger check upfront, perhaps as a convertible note at a discount into your next round, etc
Your focus needs to be on delivering on this order
5MM is likely the start of a much larger amount of capital you will need to scale and reach positive cash flow
 You should be able to get part of what you need from the company who you've been working for
 If you want to stay in that role and you're not going to be good as a CEO because it's too abstracted from the product/service or too divorced from the day-to-day work of the company, just don't be the CEO
 I can go from zero to speed quickly, then I need a team to continue the day to day stay growth
As a senior technical person at tech startups (as in, usually employee #3 or #4 at a new startup), here's what I'm looking for in a CEO: someone who understands the market and what kind of product is going to fill that need
 I'll build that product without the CEO micromanaging me and my team, but I want to know that I'm building the *right* product
 Find money, talk to potential customers to see what their needs are, and of course use the alpha and beta versions of the product we're working on so you know whether what we're doing is going to meet the needs of the customers, but don't try to tell Granny how to suck eggs
 I know how to build, what I need is someone who has the big picture on whether what I'm building is what we need in order to be successful
 It sound like you did exactly what a programmer needs to do! Look up demos, change what’s needed to more closely resemble their vision, rinse and repeat for hours a day for months at a time
 Great story! It can be challenging sometimes with all the extra needs of a business but sometimes simply focusing on the raw value and purpose can re-focus and re-energize a project
> I would build a bunch of different demos, then try to reverse engineer how they worked, and combine them for a function I wanted
Wet me know if you need any help because I’m also a complete beginner and I’m learning for my job now but it would be awesome to have another like minded person to bullshit with and code
Hi there,Im currently in the same position, I have an idea for a product but I want to be able to build a prototype myself
 But when you are talking about looking at demos and reverse engineering, what exactly do  you mean? Do you mean finding code with similar functionality and trying to see how it works? How did you go about that process?I want to make a recommendation service app for books/movies/music, and want to know a smarter way to go about that
 Everybody wants something for nothing right?
 It seems like you need this right now
As you are making more money you can afford to delegate stuff you don't want to do, allowing you to focus on things that generate a profit and scale
I've had almost this exact problem - it took a toll on me for a while, wanting to be perfect and to have 100% customer satisfaction
 also mention that if you had no income you wouldn't be able to support the free features they're currently using and would need to shut it down
You want to make it clear in the beginning that you ask for the conversion
Well, if you are making more than enough, and you want to be more stress-free, would it be a solution to hire someone, either to reply these emails, or help you with fixing those bugs you talk about (and help you with further optimizing your service)?
 The best thing I can recommend for someone wanting to start a company eventually is to: 1) Take a crack at one for 3-6 months, especially if you're still in school, just to see how difficult and how easy it is
 But also, you want cash flow
 Why? Because fuck wasting your time on seed investors, you need to iterate quickly to find product/market fit and something that works
 5) Once you have 12-18 months of living expenses saved PLUS cash flow that is 2-3x your current job PLUS a massive list of research-validated ideas that you want to experiment with, consider quitting your job and start building a high-growth, scalable startup
Also people who start a startup at 40 probably like, I dunno, are prepared and want to do it
 My first business wasn't the success I wanted, but it resulted in me learning a ton and managed to help me get a high paying job without a college degree and am now working alongside people 10-15 years my senior (with college degrees and Ivy league MBA's)TL:DR - Just get out there and learn, make dumb mistakes, get good at doing you and success will eventually follow
 Now i just need a good idea:-)
I think it's a combination of skills, network, credibility, but most importantly having a customer base and knowing what customers need
 Most importantly - i think ive development a good sense of managing my time to apply to the more important tasks versus spending eons doing every task that a startup needs in my 20s
  In my case this is something I've always wanted to do
  Maybe it just comes down to having a model of the type of business you want and thoroughly understanding that model
You need to have had a past experience that may or may not have succeeded, either as a founder or an employee
 You also need to understand the methodology between finding an idea that will solve a problem, a team of people with different disciplines who BELIEVE in your idea and are willing to work for you for little or no money at the beginning, and the right way to get funding through loans and investments
 It simplifies the two core elements needed to build a successful business
I run a Lean Startup Circle Meetup group in my home town and this is absolutely one of the biggest lessons that the majority of my new attendees need to learn
We get [i]a lot[/i] of people turn up with an idea and want to know how they can get money to turn that idea into a reality
 Too many people seem to want to get rich by replicating an idea that worked for someone else (eg t-shirt business) because the concept is so 'easy', and don't realise it's just as easy for anyone else
 Zuckerberg rather had (or maybe adopted) an insight - the insight that students want to see their college friends online with real names and participate in their social life via a online network where they can get connected, see and share updates, pictures, videos, info (especially at a place like Harvard 
 I’m happy to chat with you if you need advice
Okay, I switched over to my laptop because I wanted to share some ideas and thoughts
 You might even want to go all in on this and get rid of the Paid plan all together and just be "Photopea - 100% Forever Free Online Photo Editor"2A) Make all free users register
 Keep in mind these are all just ideas and some may not work for your business or goals, but I'm super impressed with your software and wanted to share my thoughts! Good luck!
 I have friends / clients who need to do basic things like crop, resize, compress, etc and they dont have Photoshop
 Just wanted to say thanks for sharing
 The site looks awesome and functional $5-10 per month would be nothing for someone who needs those features regularly
 With a site like this you definitely want a free version
 It may take a few uses before people want to start paying
 If they love the experience and want it to be even better they know ot wont stay completely free
Do you need help with your social media marketing? Inhave a colleague who is a difital marketer and just graduated, he may be interested in helping you to pad his resume
 If you have 14 paid users you could ask them what price they would be comfortable with, explaining that you don't make a profit and in order to continue development you need to increase your prices
 It was at a time when I was getting inquiries about the need to have site with SSL so that was what motivated some customers to upgrade
 Then *needed* it
 If you want the app to make money you'll need to find a threshold that motivates regular users to go from free to paid
 Find one or two features that your regulars *need* and make it a pro option
 I'd pay for a collaborative editor for sure, while I'd stick with GIMP for my basic needs instead of paying for an online software
 Adobe is costing us a fortune but only some of us need the full feature set of photoshop/illustrator/indesign/premiere pro
 You have a good product that people need
If I’m away from my desktop and need editing, I generally use Pixlr
As someone else mentioned, partner up with a stock image company and allow people to purchase stock from within your program, I once built a website using WIX and needed a stock image, for £1
I wanted to open a PDF, which you can do in Gimp and Photoshop, and it wasn't supported
I think that'd be a nice feature to add, although you probably don't want to advertise yourself as an "online PDF editor" unless you go *all-in* on PDFs, which is probably nasty to do
Either way, great stuff, will use for 'regular' cases from my ChromeBook, which is where I need this
 We’re a clothing company and built a real good following this way of people that genuinely want to support what you are doing
I would need to pay people also for flash mobs or other things that need people
I would need to pay people also for flash mobs or other things that need people
 Content and manual outreach to people brings you where you want to be!
very interesting and helpful ideas , we currently want to promote our new app product , do you mind if I PM you to talk about these ideas you mentioned above ?
This is a great one! I've launched my product and I do need to learn some marketing strategies
- Agree that you **want to start a company together** (the next several dozen steps will test this)
- Start with the end goal – the founders need to **agree on the exit strategy now**
 If you build a company because you want to make money you can better stop
 If you build a company to solve a need people have or to improve their lives, then great job! But please stop getting people to start companies that are doomed to fail
 And if it's a superstar team and you're well capitalized, then you can hire and fire specialists as needed
 But realistically, if you don't put your team together around the rough product and market, you're going to be missing needed competencies in the founding team
Is starting by yourself really that bad of an idea? What if your idea is low cost and you don't really need anyone else on board at the beginning?
"I don't need to have a long presentation on that
 Now all I need to know is: Can they do it, are these bozos able to make a business of it?What I usually hear is "We have a disruptive product aimed squarely at the 16-59 year female market that will alter their perception of the shoes on their feet
 The only problem is that we may need to nudge the moon into a slightly tighter orbit than it presently occupies
" Then when someone says, "But we need to only buy fair trade hay" you ask them: "Exactly how does that help with our core mission?" Now if your marketing department says "it turns out that most people think our logo looks like two ducks screwing a poodle
 **There is no clear understanding of why you need a business
 The first reason is the closure of basic needs (auto, travel, high income, the ability to make expensive purchases, etc
** You always doubt whether you need this business
 But remember: there are 20% of employees, "the backbone of the company", which you need to retain
 Most probables reasons that I found out were No market need (a vast majority), ran out of cash (excessive burning), not the right team (culture problem & wrong hires), Pricing/Cost Issues, poor customer experience and User Un-Friendly Product
" No more comments needed
This seems like the reddit version of that facebook “PM me if you want to make lots of money” scam albeit with more sophisticated lies I saw your first thread
Why do people need to PM you to get your app name? Mentioning it here will give it extra traffic
I'm curious about the "Don't incorporate until you need to
 Like you release an MVP and someone wants to invest - then consider incorporation
You don’t want to invite competition so you created this entire guide, yet if they PM you you’ll give your apps name anyways You make this look like a walk in the park by making it seem like its easy to start programming
I always wanted to visit/attend trade shows but I couldn’t time well
"  It's made more difficult by the endless articles/blog posts put out by successful companies and VCs saying "in the early stages, we're really investing in the people and not the product/traction" which means that those endless rejections are either coming because: a) people don't want to invest in *you* or b) they are lying about what they actually want
  We need more publicized stories like this, which highlight an important founder trait that I think is often forgotten- resiliency
  And requires a lot of resiliency/grit/whatever you want to call it
  If anyone needs an honest ear to complain to about this stuff, I'll happily take a call
 VCs, is that they are not so easy to identify so you need to spend extra time identifying them
 I've been through the funding process with a number of startups from angel to seed to series and now years later I'm out of it but still friends with many of the VCs and what I find is this sense that investors play with startup investments like stocks, they want to put in some money if they can manipulate the market ie news, hype etc to get it to the next round and then on to the round after that and then get out
 You want nothing that makes anyone mad or curious, it's just boring or off-topic
  The difference being was that the first campaign was essentially giving something valuable for free to a bunch of people who all had a definite and known need for something
 The second was essentially selling something to people that they want
 We even specified that we only want those ads in US only
 I'd get requests all the time from folks who wanted to start "the next Facebook"
 But don't be hard on the founder just because he wants to change the world
 However just want to say the investors also say simillar things "a lot"
 I told him "sir, with all due respect, i have an idea, i presented it, i need certain amount of money for it, and in return i am promising these profits, i do not have any further info, plz make a choice and let me know when you do", and i walked out
 If you work with startup founders that don't want to change the world, I'd run in the opposite direction
I mean don’t you need that sort of mind set to actually succeed in the start up world? 
 “Do you want to make sugar water or do you want to change the world” - Steve Jobs (something along those lines) inspired the Pepsi guy to work for him
  Yes, you need to recogniz and fix failure fast, but there is not a lot of room for failure
That translates to investors that you want to build a $billion company
99% confidence level> only want the best> the big pictureSounds like a 10x'er
 Why is that? Even if you say their products are so good they don’t need advertising, wouldn’t they still benefit from it just as much as any other startup? 
 Before doing any retargeting, you need to first understand why users aren't engaging with your website and converting
  But if you make a legitimate effort to answer each question honestly and fully, my *hope* is that you will end up with a better understanding of what works with your idea, and what needs more consideration
Working on a start up idea now and I feel like this is exactly what I need to feel more confident about it
Do you need money? What is your BATNA? If it is moving on with your life just fine you can wait
 You need me gone more than I need me gone
Do you need the money right away?If not, then (personal opinion!) what I would do is refuse to sell
In regards to what I would do in your shoes, it would depend on a few factors:- Do I like them or hate them?- How much money is involved?- How bad do they want me out of the picture?I've raised about 2M on my latest startup, we had a co-founder exit about 2 months into our raise
They may want you out of the picture in order to close the deal
  You need to know or your best guess as to their agenda in order to make the best decision for yourself
No advice on this situation but just wanted to say that's some freaking awesome growth! Good job! 
 Add to that, you made me a cofounder when it suited your needs and now you want to take that away when it is not suiting you
Then offer, I'll drop the cofounder to help you but I need to be treated fairly
  You'll have to decide how much you want to force with all the mental energy that takes vs just walk away and say "they sucked, i'm not working with them again
  It wouldn't be uncommon for an investor to really want to dig into why their investment was used to buy out a co\-founder instead of growth
  That could force a showdown if there is a first right of refusal if you really wanted to stick it to them, but it all depends on whether you think it's worth that move
 I suppose it is a balance I need to strike
 Many writers have encouraged us that we should take the position of a "consultant" who teaches, when we want to sell our stuff
 You had to be selective, and the ones you kept needed to be filed and *then* you had to archive the file
 If you needed one back you had better remember what you did with it
 I remember work environments where you needed to have things filed in a nest of Client>Project>Month folders - but if an email was relevant to two clients, you had to send it to yourself again
 I just wanted to comment not about the subject, but on the writing
I have actually written extensively on this subject for a bunch of sites ---> Figured I would share here for people who want a cleaner read or some additional tips:5 Basic Strategies: https://www
aspxBasically, this is my advice to any person with a startup who wants to get some exposure:Step 1
 The first step is to identify your high-level goals, the audience you want to reach, and the publications/writers/influencers who actually speak to that audience
 It’s also not enough to say that your audience is everyone - you need to focus on categories of people because you will need to appeal to them in different ways
Once you understand your targeting, then you need to build media lists in preparation of your outreach
 However, not 100% reliable and you need to be constantly active to monitor new requests
 This is a crazy extensive guide I wrote on guest posting that will give you everything you need to start doing it: https://powerfuloutreach
Hope this was useful in some way! If you want advice on any specific tools or techniques (list building, pitch writing, etc
 The have the ins with the people you need writing about you
 If you want more info, direct message me and I will tell you in more details about them so you can check them out yourself
I am also launching my startup within the next two months and I will agree with others here that people want to follow a story
 Please reach out if you have any questions or just want someone to bounce ideas off of! 
Congrats man!! We're rolling out a website here in the near future, and eventually want to give users the option of an app
 Your young plant has just broke through the soil and now will need a LOT of attention and nourishment to grow
Any reason you opted for iOS rather than Android app?  For social apps that need a large user base it seems like Android would be the choice, given that the market share is higher
 I'm actually learning Swift on the side to learn iOS development because I developed an interest for it and I have so ideas I want to make it come alive haha
if your app needs traffic from the public think of another way to make just enough money per conversion that would make paid ads a positive roi because adwords works great for people searching for things like houses
THIS is where you need to promote / marketing> our users have repeatedly told me that our product is the best in the market
It needs to have a large network established for the advertising to be of value to your customers
 AdWords is not the solutions all the time and if you do it you need to do it right so that your budget doesn't get depleted on searches that are never going to generate any leads
 Now I want to add another curve ball, the feedback you are getting maybe bad feedback - there is a distinction to be made between a paying user and feedback you get from those vs a "free" non-paying user - you have to be careful with feedback from users that are either NOT paying or would never pay for your product as it may lead you down the wrong path
You need to go the legal route, as the personal route isn't working
Secretly the company is going to be worthless soon and he's both embarrassed to say so, trying to hold out for some ray of light for the company, and doesn't want to be responsible for you blowing your cash on options that are about to become Bolivars
I think you need a lawyer
 I don't understand why you need to sign documents after you've left
 Lawyer up if you really want to exercise, but think about whether the tax liability on the spread is worth it (if it's significant)
You need to go by the office and have a talk face to face, don't leave until you get it
Thats pretty much lawyer territory if you need to force a hand
 If you want a quick move you could consider hiring a lawyer to write a basic demand letter
 You may want to consult a firm, free consultation, and figure your options
Assuming the 90 days exercise window is baked into an agreement, send an email saying that you want to exercise your options and repeating that you have tried multiple times to do so
 If he tries to say you waited until past the deadline, you'll have that email as proof, should you need to pursue this in the courts
  If they are clearly defined with an expiration, you need to take action immediately
 When you actually get your options there needs to be a current valuation and the board needs to consent to the valuation price
Has anyone else in the organization exercised their options? In some geographies the law requires issue of share certificates within a certain time of exercising options, and if no one has done that so far doing it the first time may involve a hell of a lot of paperwork that the CEO may not want to take on right now
If you want to exercise your options, show up with a check and deliver it to the correct person \(CFO/GC/etc
Hi David, what kind of books/document's/documenteries do you recommend a currently young individual whom wants to be an entrepreneur in the future?  Thank you for the AMA
No question - just wanted to say a hugeTHANK YOU for your angel investing book
 Does it make sense in this climate to extend seed round and raise more than is needed to withstand a series A crunch situation?
 It feels like most angel investors want to come in only when everything is working well
Ive always read to only get outside investment when you need it
 From your experience, what are some signs that you need investors?
What are the best suggestions you can give to a person who wants to do a startup? I have a few ideas floating around but nothing concrete
hi david, im doing a app startup with my team, but i need help in valuating our early stage idea and estimate future profits in order to talk with big investors and raise a reasonable amount of funds to complete the project
How would you train someone to replace you? edit: Because this is text I want to make sure that this message isn't taken maliciously
I own a patent on a PC fan product, it makes it unique (etc etc blah, you know), despite how accurate may be I on my market, since I spent my foreign currency (i live in a country with foreign currency each control), and I have no spare money to spent, I looked for a Partner-Investor to fund that last mile, but on every forum/network what I found are remoras (shark's parasites) that actually want is a working business to easy profit than a startup, where are Investor that consider actual low risk opportunities instead no-risk business ?How to deal with my situation (note I´m considering a deal o my patent which will enable me to self fund my startup, but Its nor my ideal scenario)
 It's among the best university programs for learning to run startups-especially since it's in the Bay area- which is what I want to do with my life
 how many users would a consumer focused SaaS application need to be interesting to investors?
  The technology already exists to implement it, it is just a matter of configuring it to suit my needs and building some software
Hi David, I want to come at it from a slightly different angle
I actually want to become an Angel investor not looking for investment
> You can do this effectively in a few ways:> Volunteer as little information as possible (“Hey, this is Mark”)> Sound casual and authentic> Try to only use your point of contact’s first name> Use strong language (“I need to speak with Bill”)> Step 1 should look like this:> “Hey this is (Your First Name) and I need to speak with (DM’s First Name)”> However, sometimes they’ll block you (“He’s no longer at this company”or “She doesn’t take calls directly”)
 In this case you’ll want to “rollback” and try a different approach:> “Actually, I’m not 100% sure that they’re the right person to speak with
 Afterwards, you’ll want to further qualify them with one or two more questions, such as:> “Ok perfect, and how are you handling (insert another issue they’re running into)?”> This really varies the most depending on your business case, but you can usually elaborate on another pain point they mentioned earlier
> Do you have your calendar open in front of you? I usually schedule these on Tuesdays and Thursdays, which one works better for you?”> First, you need to show genuine excitement
 Like you can make your own search engine using bing's technology but you can't call it bing and it can't look like bing, and anything you try to do to modify bing is something you need to send back to me
 I just find it so crazy nowadays that companies think proprietary software is needed to make money when people are actually buying your brand
 Long story short, You install a Noob Linux OS on their computers and then they are confused how to do anything, and ask you to put Windows back on, and then you have to tell them they need to pay $25 bucks to get their OEM Windows CD shipped to them, and that takes a week, and then I get to install that for them as a dual boot option and tell them to let their kids use Linux just to be safe, and then I get a call back 6 months later asking me to do a virus cleaning because their kids screwed it up downloading torrents
 However right now we really need somebody to open up the windows so we can let the stuffy air out and the fresh breeze come in
I just had a meeting with a big VC who wanted a month by month product roadmap and how that will affect rev for 2 years
 I have a few board members and they’re preparing me for VC funding and I haven’t even built the project yet! My approach is more bottom up: focus on my customer’s needs and getting great feedback from them
 If I can survive and thrive without an investor why do I need the investor? The logic is have a growing successful company than get an investor? But why
 And if you are not an affluent powerful individual then you will need a company that is already booming and successful to be funded
 Dont be a sucker, I had to learn the hard way and now I have a website informing all people who aren't already rich to never get into being a start-up or business because they only people who get help are the people who dont need it
  Make decisions based on the business needs not investor whims
  The entrepreneur needs to be in the driver’s seat the entire time when it comes to business decisions
 And the said business needs to be executed at a fast clip so as requiring massive capital
 I'll provide you with a NDA from us if you want
 Forget teaching yourself to be an extremely junior developer in the hope of trying to hold your own to argue deadlines with this guy, it sounds like he knows his stuff, and he will make a better technical argument for anything he wants to justify
 If he can’t split up the work himself, he is not a good software architect, the other engineer you find needs to accept  that task (look for someone with software architecture as a skill and validate that through their references)
 You will need to figure out an appropriate compensation scheme that does not reward them to collude for inefficiency, but rather incentivized them to beat each other’s estimates
 There is a balance between disruptive competition and professional pride, which you will need to find
The code is yours and you need to have it in a source code repository
 All the developer's code needs to be committed and pushed to bitbucket every day
Since you don't want to change the power dynamics (even though it sounds like maybe you should), tell the programmer that your lawyer say that all the code must be in a repository at all times
I'm going to go out and just say it - you need to hire someone or company to manage your dev for you
  You are not capable of doing this well and spending the time to get good will just use all of your time and energy you need to be running your business and finding customers
 You don't need coding skill, but you absolutely must have project management skills
 Have him define all the work that needs to be done, break it into tasks, and estimate it
 If an estimate is more than 2-3 days, it needs to be broken down further
  How many screens does he need to build? How many server calls are involved? How many SQL queries? 3rd party APIs? New APIs that he has to learn? Infrastructure that needs to be built? Map out every step from now until it's running live on a website
 As a boss, you have every right to specify specifically what needs to be done and how the work is performed
 On the people management side, a great resource is the Manager Tools podcast, it covers in simple steps all of the skills you need to run an team
 If you need more than that it gets expensive, but for 2 people it's super cheap and probably the best issue tracker and self hosted git you can get
If you go this route, you'll need someone to set it up
 Suppose you say 'I need a thing that does X' but X is this huge feature that might take 2 years to ship
 Have him help you divide them up if needed
 But it will give you the feeling of progress you need and an auditable trail you can have someone follow later if needed if he bails or is hit by a bus
 Or if he's always needing research tasks for every assignment, that also may be a sign that he's not highly skilled
 This also creates documentation in case you part ways with the developer and you need to hire someone else
 Contract an IT services shop to set it up for you if you need to
 You need backups of all his work *daily*
You don’t need to micromanage, but what you guys should be doing is discussing the high level plan, and then breaking bits of work into say two week chunks
 The main thing you need to worry about is whether it looks and acts like you want there’s not much more you’ll be able to do beyond that
You need to try and get some advice from someone with software engineering management experience (VP Software Engineering, Co-Founder of a tech company, CTO, etc)
 As others have suggested, you need to start learning about coding
 You also need to figure out a process for tracking major features and completion rates, and your dev needs to be held accountable
Have him use version control if he isn't (he probably is) and you need to get familiar with version control, this will mitigate risk on your end
 Or maybe you have a new feature that requires literally everything to change, or maybe you've reached a place with your code where you need to heavily refactor, as a result you spend days doing nothing other than deleting code and replacing it with less code that does the same thing in a better manner
 Things like this seem useless from the outside, but when you're actually working on the code you'll be very glad someone took the time to do this as this code is more maintainable and maintainable code is something you can actually rely on, vs spaghetti code which is going to need to be fully replaced when it needs to be updated
 You need to know what your dependencies are
 How are you planning to scale? What infrastructure needs will you have? These are the CTO questions, and you not being able to fill that role can lead to a situation where in the near future you have to restart from zero
 Pm me with questions if you want privacy
 I'll look at you code base if needed
 In case his own machine breaks (you don't want to lose all the work you've done
Looks for someone you trust to do due diligence for the short term to sleep well but on the long term you just need to trust him otherwise if yiu can’t you have made a wrong decision of hiring him
This is very common these days as many people want to show their importance by throwing such tantrums
com, they code review as a service to know if you want to make the code quality better in case you hire another dev in the future, it would also be beneficial for him as he will learn best practices
 It's literally like a foreign language, you need someone who is a native to interview / review his work
 Typically 20% of time should be dedicated to technical debt but if it hasn't been addressed at all then you might need a couple of months depending on project size to fix it
 sounds like you need someone in the middle
In addition to source control, which several users have mentioned, you need some way to track and plan development tasks
 If you can find budget for it, you may want to find someone trusted to serve as a CTO on a consulting or part time basis
  I don’t think you need another developer, but it sounds like you need help managing the developer you have
If you want to try and manage your developer better yourself, do some quick Internet research on Scrum and agile software development processes
 You'll have a bit of a learning curve, but you either need to learn how to manage the technical team well or find someone that can help you
 Put in place a performance Improvement procedure, and have a plan to onboard somebody new if he doesn't achieve what you want him to
 As a leader, you owe him a chance to improve and the things he needs to improve
 But you need to ensure deadlines are followed
phGetting a second dev can help with notions of ‘we need a shared repository’ and ‘peer review’
 so every time you ask him to show the code he is asking him self " why does he want to see the code?" 2 - developers cant be interrupted
 We need not to be bothered and we need a layout (agile) to work on
 And, going back to point #1, if you're relying on something coming through at the last minute to pay your team, you're not showing respect for them or their needs
For #1, you need to answer: why has no-one else moved in this market? Is it because it's a difficult problem, or is it because customers don't have a need for the product, or is it because you've invented something *completely new*?For #2, you need to answer: if no-one else has disrupted this market, are there hidden factors that I don't understand? Maybe there's regulation that isn't transparent to those outside of the industry, or there are major players who will do whatever they can to squash disruption, or maybe people are just completely fine with it how it already is
For #3, all you need to answer is: how will I get and grow my share of the pie?That *might* be some unique approach to the problem, or it might just be a goal of providing better customer service
 It's not sexy, but build your own business without trying to compete with others using a gimmick that nobody wants
So how do you gain a lot of market share? Either you need to do something first, or you need to do something better
 But regardless of whether the difference is in direction or magnitude, you do need to be different to be a startup
 Nothing wrong with not wanting to grow quickly, but it is by definition not a startup
 Pepsi doesn't need to usurp Coke, nor does Coke need to crush Pepsi, they can coexist despite their similarity
 What you need is a **Great [USP](https://en
 You can have a pizza place every 2 miles that are a success, but if you can come up with a really awesome pizza delivery app there's no need for everyone not to use it
 Based on the reaction of the interviewers, they don't really want to hear why you're *completely* different than the competition
 They do want to know if you're aware of what your competitors are doing though, and then, how you set yourself apart
       It's the details that make all the difference, it doesn't need to be radically different, it just needs to have an edge
 For instance: say I want to copy Uber and bring it to a place where it doesn't exist yet
 And the other thought is that, like you said, you don't need to be the next best thing: you just need a small corner of the market that you can call your own and that can generate the profit you want
And that's what YOU need to do
You don't need to invent something no one has ever seen before
 As long as people want it, you'll do just fine
 Private capital infused into a startup means the investors want a certain high yield/high risk return
So these investment models mean that they need to take a high risk - they have to, its part of the larger strategy and will be a written part of the contract to invest funds
 They don't want, and can't invest in "lefestyle companies," these are companies that will never have an exit or 10x return in time for the capital invested to return dividends
 Not unicornsUber needed to have exited earlier to have executed correctly
The reason is that a lot of markets are already saturated and nobody wants to gamble
 It's even less likely if you want to open up a burger resteraunt next door to a McDonald's, even though you have done all the math and research and know that you can beat them on both price and execution
