 We don't want people to have to memorize a glossary just to function at Tesla
*# Identify and focus on your top priorities – because if you don't, wtf are you doing?**Is the top priority the top priority?** What's the single most important thing you need to be doing? If you don't have an answer to this, you should drop everything and figure out what the answer is
 It's better to make 5-10% progress on the most important thing than to finish lots of tasks that don't actually move the needle
 Once you've settled on a metric (and you usually need to have some sort of counter-balancing metric, to try and mitigate the problem of perverse incentives), you'll want to make sure that you know as much as possible about how to make a positive dent in this metric
** You want to be really good at the thing that you're supposed to be handling
After years of reflection and oscillation, I came to realize that my issue wasn't with schedules per se – it was with being forced to do things that I didn't want to do
** You are a resource and you need to recharge
** Even if you have great managers, you ultimately need to take responsibility for your own learning, your own execution, your own growth
 You need to build trust and rapport with your team so you can feel comfortable doing this
 Ask for help if you need it
 But I generally get the sense that smart, respectful people tend to err on the side of caution – not wanting to interrupt others
 "Hey, when you have a moment – I need some fresh eyes to look at my slides for a few minutes and offer copy suggestions"
** It's easy to fall into a pattern of thinking that you need to focus on whatever's in front of your face
 You need to be able to zoom in and out
 Your boss hired you to do a job, she doesn't want to have to go over every single decision with you (though a good boss will do this for a while – teach a man to fish, etc)
 * **Lack Of Training And Development** >“Train people well enough so they can leave, treat them well enough so they don’t want to
 If things are not going the way management wants - there is always a better way than micromanaging people
  You will need to be in 50-100 groups and participate constantly throughout the day, each and everyday
  For example, maybe you have a hotel page and want more travel followers, you could create a 2 night all inclusive stay in your best suite for 2, full-board
 here’s my approach: if you want your account to take off quickly you need to create a feeling of authority – like you’ve been doing this for ages and have perfected every inch of your Instagram strategy
 To do that you need to laser focus on what your account is all about
“You either build the audience from scratch or go to someone who already has the audience you need
 I’d create a document of value either from my knowledge or from interviewing influencers in the market or get an existing product of value (maybe around +100$) that that audience will want
I've been seeing a lot of stuff come up about non developers wanting to start a tech company
 You don't need to be a programmer, but you do need to understand differences between front end and back end development and it would be good to know what frameworks are being used
 I was at a social event a few months back and a women with a business gave me her card and told me she wanted to have an app made
 b) At least to know what you need, what you're talking about and how to technically communicate your ideas
 Not because you'll need a business plan for whatever you're doing (You might), but because it gives you the ability to analyze and configure ideas quicker
**Edit**If you're not a technical person I think u/Chief_Executive_Anon highlights the ideal person a developer would want to work with
This is exactly what we need
 I'm not saying you have to do a business plan, but someone **needs** to be able to provide the map to becoming successful
 You just need to know the **formula**
So, let’s dive in!Note: If you want to read the article with (much) better formatting you can also find it here: [Anatomy of a Perfect Startup Pitch Deck – 11 Critical Pages](https://bluetieslides
 I don't want to do that
To do that, you need to blow them away with the solution you offer to the particular problem from slide #2
 Basically, the investor wants to know two things:- How has this market developed over time?- If it’s such a great idea, why has no one ever done this? I also refer to this as “recent trends that have made this solution possible”
 Here you are basically invited into the homes of people and get to share in their lives- In the 2000’s, Couchsurfing has become popular which is based on people letting spare room for travelers###Recent trends that have made this possibleMoving on from that, we now need to define the recent trends that have made this possible
- The gig economy is making it socially acceptable to let out your rooms and make an extra dime on the sideSumming up slide #4, here’s what you need in it:- Set-up the historical evolution of your category- Define recent trends that make your solution possible---#Slide #5: The prospective buyer and the size of the marketWe are now getting to the slide in the deck you have the least control over: The size of the market
And finally, I see so many people struggle with their presentation when all they need is an outline to follow
  &nbsp;Also, we’re currently in talks with another company that wants to test our product with one of their crews, and if they buy in, it would push our sales to over $1,000,000 next year
 In my business plan, I’d assumed we’d need at least 50 companies in our system to hit that number in sales, but we could potentially do with 3 and within the first year of actual sales
 We hired poorly - Our developer already had an app on the market that was bringing him cashflow, so he didn’t need our app to be successful
 - He was a back-end-only guy, who tried to wear the designer hat, didn’t ask for help when he needed it, and made way too many executive decisions
  &nbsp;My Dad didn’t want to split with the developer, because he felt like we’d come so far and actually had something going
 I mean we had an MVP of sorts and people wanted to use it
 And we also had a really good idea of what we needed to build, since we'd iterated like 3 times
 We’d also attended a couple of big industry meetings in 2013/2014 to get a feel for demand and there was definitely a growing need for what we wanted to build
 My Dad was talking to his buddy about the app, who’d previously seen the prototype and mentioned we needed money
 I'm not getting any younger and my son's gonna need something to work on and I think this could be it
 For the other $20k we set up a meeting with my uncle and told him we probably needed another $50k
 I was pumped! And as we were walking out the door at the end of the two-day conference, a congressman came up to my Dad and said that his company might be interested in taking a look at what we had and wanted to setup a meeting
 He’d obviously proven his ability to get shit done, so my Dad wanted to have a conversation with him regarding vestment and what it would take to get him on board
 They wanted us to come back again in February and present our software to their whole organization
 They’re owned by some of their employees and wanted to get the nod from everyone involved
 He’s our “gray hair” and if you’re young you need a gray hair
 I think it was partly due to the pressure of having unproven software and partly due to the fact that I don’t really like the idea of convincing people to buy something they know nothing about and might not even want
 However, when you get your first customer, selling starts to feel a lot less like “selling” and a lot more like you’re providing people with something they **need**
 You should never try to convince a customer to buy if they don’t want to, because if you’re a genuine believer in your product, others will become believers too
  &nbsp;The only other people in there were two dudes sitting at the bar and as soon as we got up to leave one of the bar-guys yelled, “You guys want a water moccasin shot?” We replied, “No, it’s getting late and I think we’re gonna go to bed
 Somehow, because things started to blur, it comes up that I have some software for tracking stuff in the industry, so he starts describing an app he wants
 I laughed and said, “Dude! I built that two years ago and no one wanted it, so we had to build something different
” He slapped his knee and said, “Well I want it! How much can I get it for?” I pitched him my starting price and he immediately countered at half, which is what I actually wanted, and responded, “Deal!” We shook hands and he proceeded to tell us the most ridiculous and hilarious stories I’ve ever heard in my life
  &nbsp;Also, we’re currently in talks with another company that wants to test it with one of their crews, and if they buy in, it would push our sales to over $1,000,000 next year

 Whenever I hear someone say, "Hey, it's just business!", I roll my eyes and recognize that's someone I wouldn't want to do business with
One more little snippet of what investors want to hear while I'm on a little ramble
 They want to hear something like "95% of the money is growth capital that is going to sales and marketing
\[Edit\] Below is a story posted on Medium by a friend of mine, /u/mottlemike which I wanted to share with you here\[/edit\]**Startups are Financial Suicide**In 2009 when I left Google, I had over $100,000 in my bank account
 I worked hard to save that money, and did so because I wanted to create a startup
 \(No need to feel sorry for me — I’ll be fine! This article is actually about you
 On one hand, that’s great! The world needs more innovation
 All I needed to focus on was “maximising shareholder value” and the rest would follow
Over the next few months I want to publish more of what I’ve learned in the last 9 years
 But, before I do, I wanted to make one thing clear: startups are extremely dangerous!That should have been obvious to me, right? For some reason it wasn’t
 Science also shows that to-do-lists also eliminate the negative cognitive effects of unfinished goals, freeing your mind up to actually focus on the task you need to do now
 You may think you’re naturally a short sleeper, but you’re probably wrong, with scientists believing only 5% of people have the genetic mutation required to need only 6 hours of sleep
 When faced with any large task or group of tasks, break what you need to do into short, timed chunks(called “Pomodoros”) that are broken up by short breaks
 Having already completed a task, you will have the momentum needed to accomplish the rest of your daily goals

Just wanted to make a thread out of sheer excitement
  So MouthOnFace is claiming any promises of equity made were for another company and not relevant to this one* Weigh carefully how much you want to invest - how far you want to lean out into this venture - and track your actuals against that targetTomorrow I am filing suit against MouthOnFace to recover nearly 900 hours of work I did - unpaid - at a time when those hours could have been far better spent on other cash-generating projects
**Lesson 3: Patents and NDA's in the Real World*** If you are working on something that is legitimately patentable (a whole other topic), you will be in this situation: you want it protected but do not have the cash to get an actual good patent filed, so you MUST* Get a (much cheaper) NDA around the specific tech you want to demonstrate - I skipped this step
"  Not always possible, but in our case a cutaway prototype that we thought would be helpful was essentially the open kimono that gave them everything they needed* I was too excited to share the beauty and simplicity of my solution, and too excited to be "there" with the big kids that I let my guard way down and now, even though I have filed a Utility Patent on the design, I am left with no bargaining power beyond how much I'm willing to pay an attorney to argue on my behalf with one of their team of attorneys (who are riding a far taller pile of cash)If you made it this far, thanks for reading
**You know what you want to achieve, the dev knows what you tell them to do in the scoping document

 We talked about the friendship, how we don't want work to get in the way, and came up with a strategy to finish out the website to where we're both happy
 We agreed that there needs to be more communication between us, and he apologized for not taking the deadline seriously
 They should be working not only on their roles, but willing to help where they can on other areas as needed
 Now I'm nowhere close to an MVP but already have 3  big potential customers that want to speak
 I planned to raise money from friends and family when I needed more before doing a larger series
 I’m going to need around $2
 I’ve never needed that much money that quickly, so any tips or guidance would be awesome
 I’m running a well thought out and well structured company, not a lemonade stand (<- this was intended to be humorous, I hope it comes across that way) More seriously, I know that there’s no way for commenters to know details about me and the company, so I want to take this opportunity to explain a bit about my team and the goal of this post: Excited though we are, we’re not dumb or unprepared
 I wanted to make this post as means to brainstorm with the people from this incredible community and perhaps light the bulb on an idea that we hadn’t considered before (one comment did just that and we’ve immediately started considering an avenue that we hadn’t before)So I wanted to add that although nothing is guaranteed in life, we have done our best to have our legal and management bases covered
 You have a large team of opinionated people and you need to inspire, convince, and direct them instead of practicing battlefield command and control
  I just wanted to tell people a little bit about the process and how I did it in hopes it will inspire more people to build something
  When I started it was out of a need
 I knew some of the stuff I wanted to build, but no clue how to build it
  I would build a bunch of different demos, then try to reverse engineer how they worked, and combine them for a function I wanted
 The app was actually a lot of fun for me, and the couple pictures I posted were met with, I want that app
Just need to get it out of my system
 Obviously causation isn't correlation, so what are the things that get better with 'age'? Is it simply more experience managing? A broader network to draw from? More failures under your belt \(and lessons learned\)? Something else? I have had many ideas that I've wanted to make a startup out of, but I still feel so inexperienced and unprepared
Idea * Execution = Business    Bad Idea = -1    OK Idea = 5    Good Idea = 10    Great Idea = 15    Brilliant Idea = 20    Bad execution = $1    OK Execution = $10,000    Good Execution = $100,000    Great Execution = $1,000,000    Brilliant Execution = $10,000,000I find this is one of the first lessons all startup founders need to take to heart to succeed
 I wanted to say 'yes' because I know how much other work they have to do to build a successful company
 The builder wants to save as much money as possible until the building is at least partially occupied, so he decides to save money on the foundation by leaving out the rebar - hoping he can come back and add it later
- Agree that you **want to start a company together** (the next several dozen steps will test this)
- Start with the end goal – the founders need to **agree on the exit strategy now**
 May only need one page of text, 12 month budget, three year projections and capital structure
)- Think carefully about whether there is anything else you need in a founding **shareholders agreement**
 In Canada, all startups need corporate tax, payroll tax and GST tax accounts on Day One
 Many will also need PST – this one is most often overlooked

 Most of the companies (if not all) are relatively unknown, but all we need to know is why they failed
**Inadequate/Misleading Market Research**42% of startups fail due to the fact that they failed to solve a market need
 KOLOS is another business that got shut down in the same period and their reason was, “Our product is not something people wanted”

* Don't incorporate until you *need* to
 Like you release an MVP and someone wants to invest - then consider incorporation
 Each page should have 1 H1 tag/2~3 H2 tags/2~5 H3 tags, and P tags - all with the keyword you want targeted
 Google is smart but it still needs to understand your page
 If your page is about sushi toppings and you want to rank for those keywords, then write 300~400 words on sushi toppings
 Use keywords you want to rank for

This article has been making the rounds but I hadn't seen it here, so I wanted to share it
The product is great, it's got revenues and real potential but our success will be based on being smart, executing quickly and knowing how to go to market - not because our product came out the arse of a unicorn and has magical powers - and working for a guy that says dumb shit like this just makes me want to punch myself in the face
 Either way he say the biggest role he would need me to do when joining the company is to prepare the budget and financial forecast to be shown to investors
 I knew this was bullshit but didn't give much thought until he asked me to take up the directorship of the company, citing that "we need a bank account and the country and banking industry is afraid of foreigners like myself"
 He claims he wants to get Euro 4-6million in funding in first year so I should prepare the budget based on 20 million and then subsequently revise it down to 10 million like that before settling for his targetted amount
 This guy just simply doesn't want people to know where his exact location is
 Naturally when briefly asked about his hiring principal he mention he only want the best
 Heck word from the HR person is initially he has 3 candidate whom he thinks suitable for PA role but decided he wants ALL 3
 Personally observing the mundane task given to the PA it seems he doesn't even need a PA in the first place
 Further more two months later he decided his two PA useless because in his word "They're not doing anything and as a PA they should know my needs and act accordingly"
 He keep on boasting about the need to get good stuff but is dumbfounded when candidates refuse to join because the company offer no EPF and SOCSO
 All he wants is people who look nice
It helps with transparency within companies as well — messages that would have normally been emails can just be dropped into a quick message in a channel, so that the team is informed without needing to CC everyone on an endless thread of emails
As Butterfield has pointed out in an interview with Fast Company, “People need to feel confident that when they read a document or conversation, they don’t have to worry about labeling or storing it — that they’ll be able to find it again later if and when they need it
Slack understands that in order to \(success\)fully replace email, they need to integrate with every app from which their target audience would normally get email notifications
**First,** before talking more specifically about remarketing, one thing you need to understand about marketing in general is a basic but critical concept called "effective frequency"
But aside from super cheap products that rely on impulse buys, you're almost always going to need to get in front of your prospective customers multiple times
 "Frequency capping" is how many times you want to show your ads to each person, and "membership duration" is how long you want to keep advertising to them

  You need to physically write this down (type it out, whatever) and revise and refine it until it's succinct, clear, and complete
  Duh, right?  I'll make money by selling XYZ!!  Great, true - but you need to get a little more nitty-gritty than that
Well, here was the reality:* It is extremely unlikely that you will actually bill 40 hours per week with one person* Companies using smaller independent contractors want work done now, so it's unusual to have more than 1 or 2 concurrent projects going with happy customers* If I was not at my desk, at my computer with my hand on the mouse, I was losing money, not making it
One of the most common constraints in reality is the **"I need another me"** scenario
  When it's time to grow, you need more of your own secret sauce - but there is only one you

 Inbox identifies and categorizes your emails so that you can quickly see what needs to be addressed and what can be archived or saved for later
 They decided to streamline Gmail while keeping the advanced features available for those who wanted them
Inbox is quite useful for those of us who need to go through hundreds of emails a day — and it certainly helps keep your email experience a bit more pleasant and organized
 I have some vested equity that I want to exercise but every time I bring it up to the CEO, he responds very slowly or gives me an answer that requires me to wait a couple of days
 I’d be happy to answer any of the questions you’ve always wanted to ask about how startup fundraising works, how to make sure you’re working on the right thing, and how to avoid the common mistakes you might not even be aware you’re about to make
com/davidsrose), but I'm here now and ready to answer anything you want to ask!EDIT: That was fun! Thanks everyone for the good questions, and I hope the answers were helpful
 You can do this effectively in a few ways:* Volunteer as little information as possible (“Hey, this is Mark”)* Sound casual and authentic* Try to only use your point of contact’s first name* Use strong language (“I need to speak with Bill”)Step 1 should look like this:>“Hey this is (Your First Name) and I need to speak with (DM’s First Name)”However, sometimes they’ll block you (“He’s no longer at this company”or “She doesn’t take calls directly”)
 In this case you’ll want to “rollback” and try a different approach:>“Actually, I’m not 100% sure that they’re the right person to speak with
 Afterwards, you’ll want to further qualify them with one or two more questions, such as:>“Ok perfect, and how are you handling (insert another issue they’re running into)?”This really varies the most depending on your business case, but you can usually elaborate on another pain point they mentioned earlier
>Do you have your calendar open in front of you? I usually schedule these on Tuesdays and Thursdays, which one works better for you?”First, you need to show genuine excitement
 **BRINGING IT ALL TOGETHER**Now, let’s tie everything we learned into a smooth script:The Person:>“Hey this is (Name) and I need to speak with (Decison Maker’s)”*wait patiently and enjoy the hold music*The Hook:>“Hey this is (Name) from (Company), did I catch you at a good time? Thanks, I’ll be really quick

Assuming it's all good, what can go wrong?So if you're convinced that you don't need to jump ship, the truth is things could go wrong
I just wanted to put this out there because I hear a lot of new founders asking me things like “how much MRR do I need to get to in order to get my seed round?” or “do you think investors will understand my business?” etc
Let me just stress this, DO NOT DO THIS!It’s great to be thinking of what investors want to see because it means you’re obviously focused on growing your company at some point
 If more people focused on making solid businesses rather than what investors wanted, they’d all be better off
It’s really tough to understand the difference between needing more money to scale and how you get those dollars versus just focusing on building your business to a point where investors will come to you
By the way, here is an important lesson about delegation: remember that everyone else is also most productive when they’re doing what they like, and do what you’d want other people to do for you—try to figure out who likes (and is good at) doing what, and delegate that way
It’s important to learn that you can learn anything you want, and that you can get better quickly
  I make lists of what I want to accomplish each year, each month, and each day
I am relentless about getting my most important projects done—I’ve found that if I really want something to happen and I push hard enough, it usually happens
 I don’t think most people value their time enough—I am surprised by the number of people I know who make $100 an hour and yet will spend a couple of hours doing something they don’t want to do to save $20
  I otherwise aggressively avoid stimulants, but I will have more coffee if I’m super tired and really need to get something done
**OTHER STUFF**Here’s what I like in a workspace: natural light, quiet, knowing that I won’t be interrupted if I don’t want to be, long blocks of time, and being comfortable and relaxed (I’ve got a beautiful desk with a couple of 4k monitors on it in my office, but I spend almost all my time on my couch with my laptop)
I don't want to micro manage, to suddenly change the dynamics of our relationship and interfere with him if he is doing what great job
I wanted to share a bit of cautionary advice with the r/startups community \- before you accept an offer with any new company/firm/startup, make sure that you know their REAL financial position
 It's okay to make a startup and have it be just about an industry you want to work in
